# Branwen for BGII
A playable modding tutorial NPC mod for BGII!

Branwen NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Branwen for short) is an add-on for the game Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack. Throne of Bhaal content is present.

Branwen, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a True Neutral human cleric. She worships Tempus, and one of her most famous quotes is "By Tempus' shield!"

The mod is compatible with all BGII games: BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET! 

*But note: for BGII:EE and EET, if you want to create a mod that uses any other letters or symbols than the latin (english) alphabet, you need to provide the texts in UTF-8 (without BOM) format, whereas the original game needs them in ANSI. So in case you do, you'll need to get familiar with using d/tra-pairs in your mod ("traify-ing" your mod) and using HANDLE_CHARSETS + iconv.exe for text transformation upon install. 
Branwen NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II does not contain this, one reason being that it was originally written before the EE was available, but we still think it's a good first start and if you reached the level of this mod with yours, then your modding skills will be good enough to go the step to unsing weidu --traify without problems! -jastey*
